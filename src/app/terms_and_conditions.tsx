        The following notices and licenses comprise together the MIT
        OpenCourseWare License.

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        MIT OpenCourseWare respects your privacy. We do not collect personally
        identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide it,
        such as when you provide email contact information to subscribe to the
        OCW newsletter, send feedback to OCW, or respond to a survey. If you
        voluntarily provide your email address or other contact information, we
        might also use it to inform you of changes to OCW, to survey you about
        your use or opinion of OCW, or to ask for your support. At your request,
        we will remove your contact information from our files.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not make your contact information or any other personally
        identifiable information available to anyone outside OCW or its service
        providers (who use the information only for authorized OCW purposes)
        unless we are legally required to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the above, we collect certain anonymous (non-personally
        identifiable) information to help us improve the OCW web site and to
        evaluate the access and use of OCW materials and the impact of OCW on
        the worldwide educational community:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            We collect information you provide about your use of and
            satisfaction with OCW through email you send us, through the OCW
            feedback form, and through OCW surveys, whether or not you
            voluntarily include your contact information.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We use the Google Analytics web analytics service, which collects
            certain data about this website&apos;s traffic via a DoubleClick
            cookie and the standard Google Analytics implementation. The
            specific Google Analytics feature we use is Google Analytics
            Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics Demographics
            and Interest Reporting enables OCW to use information such as user
            age, gender and interests from Google&apos;s Interest-based
            advertising or 3rd-party audience data to improve services on the
            OCW website and to help us understand the aggregate demographics of
            our users. We cannot and do not obtain personally-identifiable
            information from Google Analytics. OCW does not and will not merge
            any personally-identifiable information with non-personally
            identifiable information unless you have been given notice of and
            have given prior affirmative (i.e. opt-in) consent to that merger.
            Google&apos;s ability to use and share information collected by
            Google Analytics about your visits to OCW is restricted by the{" "}
            <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">
              Google Privacy Policy
            </a>
            . You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return
            visits to this website by disabling (opting out) the{" "}
            <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">
              Google Analytics cookie
            </a>
            . You can also view and change the currently available settings for{" "}

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We may use other web analysis tools that are built into the OCW web
            site to measure and collect anonymous session information.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We also use “cookies” to improve your OCW web experience and to
            collect anonymous information about how you use OCW. However,
            cookies are not required for OCW use. If your browser is configured
            not to accept cookies, you will still be able to access OCW and its
            content.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When we report information about OCW access, use, and impact, we report
        aggregate, non-personally identifiable data. Occasionally, we report
        quoted feedback from users. We do not attribute feedback to specific
        individuals unless we obtain permission to use that person&apos;s name
        along with the feedback.

        No warranties are given. The license may not give you all of the

      </p>
      <h2>Use of MIT Name</h2>
      <p>
        “MIT”, “Massachusetts Institute of Technology”, and its logos and seal
        are trademarks of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Except for
        purposes of attribution as required by our Creative Commons License, you
        may not use MIT&apos;s names or logos, or any variations thereof,
        without prior written consent of MIT. You may not use the MIT name in
        any of its forms nor MIT seals or logos for promotional purposes, or in
        any way that deliberately or inadvertently claims, suggests, or in
        MIT&apos;s sole judgment gives the appearance or impression of a
        relationship with or endorsement by MIT.
      </p>
      <h2 className="h2">MIT Interpretation of “Non-commercial”</h2>
      <p>
        Non-commercial use means that users may not sell, profit from, or
        commercialize OCW materials or works derived from them. The guidelines
        below are intended to help users determine whether or not their use of
        OCW materials would be permitted by MIT under the “non-commercial”
        restriction. Note that there are additional requirements (attribution
        and share alike) spelled out in our{" "}
        <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/terms/#cc">license</a>.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Commercialization is prohibited.</b> Users may not directly sell
            or profit from OCW materials or from works derived from OCW
            materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: A commercial education or training business may not offer
            courses based on OCW materials if students pay a fee for those
            courses and the business intends to profit as a result.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>
              Determination of commercial vs. non-commercial purpose is based on
              the use, not the user.
            </b>{" "}
            Materials may be used by individuals, institutions, governments,
            corporations, or other business whether for-profit or non-profit so
            long as the use itself is not a commercialization of the materials
            or a use that is directly intended to generate sales or profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: A corporation may use OCW materials for internal
            professional development and training purposes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>
              Incidental charges to recover reasonable reproduction costs may be
              permitted.
            </b>{" "}
            Recovery of nominal actual costs for copying small amounts (under
            1000 copies) of OCW content on paper or CDs is allowed for
            educational purposes so long as there is no profit motive and so
            long as the intended use of the copies is in compliance with all
            license terms. Students must be informed that the materials are
            freely available on the OCW Web site and that their purchase of
            copied materials is optional.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: An institution in a remote area has limited Internet access
            and limited network infrastructure on campus, and a professor offers
            to create CDs of OCW materials relevant to her course. The professor
            may recover the costs of creating the CDs.
          </p>
        </li>

      <h2>Infringement Notification</h2>
      <p>
        OCW, prior to making any OCW Materials publicly available, has reviewed

        available on OCW. OCW will promptly remove any material that is
        determined to be infringing on the rights of others. If you believe that
