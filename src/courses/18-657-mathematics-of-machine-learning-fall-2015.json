As such it has been a fertile ground for new statistical and algorithmic developments. The purpose of this course is to provide a mathematically rigorous introduction to these developments with emphasis on methods and their analysis.\n\nYou can read more about Prof. Rigollet's work and courses [on his website](http://www-math.mit.edu/~rigollet/).\n",
